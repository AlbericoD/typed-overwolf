# ~~THIS REPOSITORY IS CURRENTLY NOT ACTIVELY MAINTAINED.
Ideally, there will be a @types version at some point found in [this repo](https://github.com/Colorfulstan/overwolf-dts).
You still can use this type definitions, and contributions for updates are welcome.~~
I started using these definitions again in another project, so might do some minor updates now and then.

Overwolf is working on an officially maintained version, so I won't go out of my way to get it @types ready.

# Overwolf-types
typescript definitions for overwolf API

Usage:

1) add .d.ts to your project
2) in files where you use overwolf, add `declare const overwolf: Static` on top to get typings for the global overwolf object. import additional types as needed.

There certainly are ways to declare it for your project, but I'm too ~~lazy~~ busy right now to recall how.
Comments/Pull requests always appreciated!
